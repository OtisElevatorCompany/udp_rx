***The following command will firewall off a port for preventing a third party redirecting messages
using udp_rx***

sudo iptables -I input -i eth0 -p udp --dport [port to REJECT] -j REJECT

***NOTE
You will need to do this rule for each port+interface, so if you have 2 devices and 2 ports
you will need 4 rules!***
